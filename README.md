# 🎮 Game Glitch Investigator: The Impossible Guesser

## 🚨 The Situation

You asked an AI to build a simple "Number Guessing Game" using Streamlit.
It wrote the code, ran away, and now the game is unplayable. 

- You can't win.
- The hints lie to you.
- The secret number seems to have commitment issues.

## 🛠️ Setup

1. Install dependencies: `pip install -r requirements.txt`
2. Run the broken app: `python -m streamlit run app.py`

## 🕵️‍♂️ Your Mission

1. **Play the game.** Open the "Developer Debug Info" tab in the app to see the secret number. Try to win.
2. **Find the State Bug.** Why does the secret number change every time you click "Submit"? Ask ChatGPT: *"How do I keep a variable from resetting in Streamlit when I click a button?"*
3. **Fix the Logic.** The hints ("Higher/Lower") are wrong. Fix them.
4. **Refactor & Test.** - Move the logic into `logic_utils.py`.
   - Run `pytest` in your terminal.
   - Keep fixing until all tests pass!

## 📝 Document Your Experience

- [x] Describe the game's purpose.
- [x] Detail which bugs you found.
- [x] Explain what fixes you applied.

## 📸 Demo Walkthrough

Describe your fixed game in numbered steps so a reader can follow along without watching a video:

1. User enters 40 → game shows "Go HIGHER!".
2. Attempts left drops to 7. (The hint now points the correct direction.)
3. User enters 90 → game shows "Go LOWER!". Attempts left drops to 6.
4. User enters 73 → "You won! The secret was 73", and the final score is displayed.
5. User clicks New Game → a new secret is drawn, the input box is cleared, 
6. Attempts left resets to 8, and score/history reset to zero.
